# Random Forest Classifier for Skin Cancers


This was a pair-programming excercise, the team members are Tommaso Capecchi and myself.

For this project a Random Forest was implemented to classify data of different types of Skin Lesions. 

The random_forest_classifier_introtoAI file contains the random forest's implementation.

The augmented_dataframe file is a csv file which contains a total of 46890 datapoints(of which 10000 are taken from the HAM10000 dataset, and the rest are augmented).
